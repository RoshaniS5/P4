# Project Iris by Sleepy Starfish  
Project Iris is a collection of anonymous drawings with notes like that of The Unsent Project (https://theunsentproject.com/). The Unsent Project is made up of texts that were not sent towards their loved ones, in it you can choose color and a name to send it to. On Project Iris, you can see notes in order of time submission and are also able to search for notes directed towards a certain name. In addition to text, users will be able to attach drawings to their notes.
